## üîß If Logo Doesn't Show

### Problem 1: Logo Not Appearing

**Check:**
1. Did you upload to correct field?
   - Use "Site Logo Dark" for footer (preferred)
   - Or "Site Logo" as fallback

2. Did you save settings?
   - Click "Save Settings" button

3. Is file path correct?
   ```
   Should be: /uploads/general/your-logo.png
   Not: C:\Users\...\logo.png
   ```

4. Hard refresh browser
   ```
   Windows: Ctrl + F5
   Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   ```

---

### Problem 2: Logo Wrong Color

**Issue:** Dark logo on dark footer (invisible!)

**Fix:**
```
Option 1: Upload white version to "Site Logo Dark"
Option 2: The footer auto-applies white filter (brightness-0 invert)
```

**Test:**
- If logo is dark: Use "Site Logo Dark" with white version
- If logo is light: Regular logo works fine

---

### Problem 3: Logo Too Big/Small

**Adjust in code:**

```tsx
// In Footer.tsx, find:
<Image
  width={180}      // Change this
  height={60}      // And this
  className="h-12" // Or adjust display height
/>
```

**Quick size adjustments:**
```tsx
Small:   className="h-10"  (40px)
Medium:  className="h-12"  (48px) ‚Üê Current
Large:   className="h-14"  (56px)
XLarge:  className="h-16"  (64px)
```

---

### Problem 4: Logo Blurry

**Cause:** Image too small, scaled up

**Fix:**
1. Use higher resolution image
2. Minimum: 180x60px
3. Recommended: 240x80px or larger
4. Use PNG or SVG format

---

## üì± Mobile Considerations

### Logo on Mobile Footer

**Current behavior:**
- Logo scales down automatically
- Height: `h-12` (48px) on mobile
- Height: `h-14` (56px) on desktop

**To change mobile size only:**
```tsx
className="h-10 sm:h-12"
           ‚Üë       ‚Üë
         mobile  desktop
```

---

## üé® Logo Styling Options

### Make Logo Brighter
```tsx
// Remove white filter:
className="h-12" // Remove: brightness-0 invert

// Result: Shows original logo colors
```

### Add Logo Background
```tsx
<div className="bg-white p-2 rounded-lg inline-block">
  <Image src={...} className="h-12" />
</div>

// Result: Logo on white background
```

### Add Logo Shadow
```tsx
<Image
  className="h-12 drop-shadow-lg"
  //              ‚Üë Adds shadow
/>
```
