# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Statistics Not Updating

## 🎯 The Problem
You updated statistics in admin panel but they're not showing on the website.

## ✅ The Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server

**In your backend terminal:**
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

**Why?** The code that sends statistics to frontend was updated and needs restart.

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser

**Choose ONE method:**

**Option A - Keyboard Shortcut:**
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

**Option B - Clear Cache:**
```
F12 → Application → Clear Storage → Clear site data
```

**Option C - Restart Browser:**
```
Close browser completely → Reopen → Visit site
```

## 🧪 Test It Works

1. **Visit:** `http://localhost:3000/projects`
2. **Should see:** "10+ Expert Engineers" (or your value)
3. **Also check:** Projects Completed should show "1000+"

**If it works:** ✅ Done! Your statistics are now dynamic!

**If not working:** See troubleshooting below

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend not restarting?
```powershell
# Kill any node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Restart backend
cd backend

```

### Still seeing old values?
1. Check backend terminal for errors
2. Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/public/settings`
3. Should see `"stats_team_members": 10` in JSON response
4. If not there, re-initialize settings:
   - Go to Admin → Settings
   - Click "Initialize Default Settings"
   - Click "Statistics" tab
   - Update values
   - Click "Save Settings"

### Frontend shows errors?
```
F12 → Console
Look for red errors
Share them for help
```
